So the website is up but it isnt quiet good enought yet. Lets make a list shall we
1. ~~It is just using the default theme from Jekyll, I should change it to a different premade one or create my own~~
2. ~~The posts seem to just be displaying the current date on the homepage as supposed to when they were published~~
3. I need to figure out how to use Jekyll to its full potential. Sending small commits to github only to have them not work is getting frustrating.
4. Figure out how to type exactly what I am thinking and just start putting it out into the world.
5. Figure out what this RSS is and how to fix the link
6. ~~Add comment section on indivual posts...idk if this is even possible due to how the webpage is hosted~~
7. That should be good for now

I case anyone wants to know, this page is a .markdown as supposed to a .html. So I will have to learn an all new set of syntax on this journey. I hope some of the people I love have made it to this point. I am going to keep working on building this site and my skills out as much as possible. I need a change and I love being on computers. But enough chit chat. Below you should hopefully see a picture of the homepage so as to mark the start of the long adventure that will be this blog.
