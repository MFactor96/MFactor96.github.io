It took me about 4 days to simply get this shell of a framework up and running. As I struggled with figuring out how to get Ruby and Jekyll to work on windows. I can't help but think that was fun! Just trying and failing over and over. But now I have it! A testament to stubborness. Def why I like Dark Souls.
