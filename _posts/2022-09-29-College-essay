Alright this one is going to be a trip. I need to write an essay about me for the college application and I am going to do it on here. It is a frightning thought but here we are.

It needs to have a 250-650 word count and be about one of the following:
-  Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story. 
-  The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience? 
-  Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome? 
-  Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you? 
-  Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. 
-  Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?  
-  Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design. 

On a quick first glance at my options, I think the best topic to choose whould be "Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?". Creating and adjusting this blog is that for me. I think it would fit pretty well and maybe just maybe writing an essay about it and me won't be too awful for me.
