Here goes nothing. For those of you that don't know I am currently working as a maintenace manager for a landscaping company. I directly oversee an irrigation tech and a genernal laborer. Most of my work involves tranistioning over properties from the construction side to setting them up with my varity of sub contractors to mow. Not exactly a very technical job that's why I started this blog to help grow those skills. 

Anywhos, my irrigation tech has been dealing with a ton of personal stuff lately causing him to be less than ideal with the quality of work he has been doing. This makes it so where most of my time is taken up with covering for him when he doesn't show up and dealing with the mistakes he makes. It has been a frustrating experience when other problems begin to compound on one another. I am just very tired with how this company is currently set up. Too much work, too high of expectations, no good quality control, and not enough employees. But it feels like it is probably like that just about everywhere.

I am trying my best to find some joy in things. As a whole I think I tend to be a bit more on the negative side as far as life outlooks go. Nothing ever seems right for me. Not in jobs, not with relationships. Someday I hope it will get better, I just wish I could see what the correct choices are to take me down that path. Maybe it's just my perception of things that needs to change. Rewire my brain. 

Code is far from easy but at least its logical in the way it functions. People are way to complicated, all of us. I suppose it's about time for another drastic change. If only things weren't so expensive.

I used to think I was an intelligent person but now I know I am not anything special. Not good enough at most things. I can feel myself losing focus because I am unsure about what the correct path is for me.
