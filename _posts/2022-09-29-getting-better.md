Now the really reason I took so long to come up with this "list" is that I couldn't think of a cool new way to format it with markdown syntax. But the show must go on. I think I will try and do some fun table artwork or something.

|---|---|---|**CODING**|---|---|---|
|---|---|**being me**|---|**being happy**|---|---|
|---|**Civ 5**|---|---|---|**Star Citizen**|---|
|**eating**|---|---|---|---|---|**socializing**|
|---|**CODING**|---|---|---|**CODING**|---|
|---|---|**CODING**|---|**CODING**|---|---|
|---|---|---|**CODING**|---|---|---|

I dont really like the green in the table, but hey it will have to work for now.
