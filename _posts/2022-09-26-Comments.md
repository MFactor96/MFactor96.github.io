***Comments are enabled!!!! Yah!!!***
All it took was a simple github app to be installed in the local repo and a small chunk of code to be put in the post layouts.

{% highlight ruby %}
    <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="MFactor96/MFactor96.github.io"
        issue-term="pathname"
        theme="github-dark"
        crossorigin="anonymous" 
        async>
    </script>
{% endhighlight %}

All you need to comment is have a free github login and your should be able to comment away! Technically speaking you are more of creating an issue in my github repository and the app is translating it and placing it where it should be!
