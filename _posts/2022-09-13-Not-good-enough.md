All the stuff I am not good at...What a list to make. So instead I will make a table!

| Things I am not good at | Things I am not good at also |
|---|---|
| Making lists | Drawing |
| Talking to new people | Living on my own |
| Cooking | Being comfortable |
| Remembering Birthdays | Relationships |
| Voice acting | Writing Stories |
| Hunt Showdown | Spelling |
| Camping | Being spontaneous |
| Coding | Riding horses |

Now I am sure there are plenty of other things that I am not good at, but that's a good enough table. And with it now that I have lowered my ego a bit it's time to make a ***list!***

Things I am good enough at
--------------------
1. Most games
2. Making tables
3. Making keurig coffee
4. Waking up on time
5. Landscaping
6. Money management
7. 
8. 
9. 
10. 
11. 
12. 
13. 
14. 
15. 
16. 
17. 
18. 

I am just awful at making lists. Soon I will ☯️ balance these both out!
