While the first attempt at an essay wasn't the worst probably, I feel like it failed to answer the actual questions from the prompt.
***Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?***

Why does it captivate me? I think it is because when I hit a difficult part I know there are probably many different ways to solve it and I know I am far from the first person to run into the problem. After all we are all standing on the backs of giants. I hope to some day be the giant that others take from. I think the other part that captivates me is the near unlimited possibilites of it all. It isn't hard to add in a color swap or add little disclaimer tags to posts. Anything I can think of that I want to add to my site is doable maybe not easy but doable. 

Now the what or who do I turn to question. That one I feel like I don't have a great answer to. I have found places like stack overflow to be very helpful when running into problems with my code. I have been learning a bit from Code Academy and Youtube has a lot of nice tutorials on a lot of different things. I wish I had a little better of a social group that I could bounce ideas off of a bit more.
